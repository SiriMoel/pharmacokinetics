An alchemy mod about managing your magical liquid intake.
This mod adds new materials, merchant npcs, growable plants, and a stat bar to manage.

Manage how you ingest magical liquids, create new magical materials, and grow plants. 
Try not to get addicted to magical liquids & be careful not to let the bar fill up completely.
